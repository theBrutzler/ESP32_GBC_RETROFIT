# Hardware info
- Unknown ESP-32 (Most likely ESP32-WROVER-B) (SOC)

# Known issues:
- Battery meter needs to be configured.
- Cropping most noticeable on NES, SNES, Genesis, PC Engine.
- Scaling option for above should eventually be removed or changed if downscaling is added.
- Disk LED does nothing (or isn't mapped yet) and should be removed for this target.
- Sometimes takes more than one attempt to flash. (Stock bootloader problem? Hardware?)
- Would benefit from a custom theme for small screens.
